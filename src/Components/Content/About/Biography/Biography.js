          I'm a 20 year old student pursuing a Software Engineering degree. I
          love to code and I've been learning how to
          code from my school and through really wonderful resources online.
          Learning process has been fun and very challenging at times.
          Nevertheless, it has always been my dream job to be a web developer. I
          started my programming career when I was 18 and it has been great
          since.
