          I always love to play games since i was young but I am a total noob at
          playing it competitively. One of the best game ive played is Red Dead
          Redemption 2, really recommend giving it a try.

          I love computers hardware too. Watching youtubers such as LTT build
          cool computers and servers are fun to watch. Building a PC is totally
          one of my bucketlist I wish to complete.
